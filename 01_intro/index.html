<h1>Part I: Final Project Proposals</h1>

<p class = "margin"></p>
I am currently considering the following three ideas for my final project:
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h3 class="highlight">IDEA 1: The Walnut-O-Mat 3000</h3 class="highlight">

<p>I have a love-hate relationship with squirrels and other rodents: while I find them extremely cute, they wreak havoc in my garden, and I've spent countless hours trying to keep them away from my produce. (<a href="youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg&amp;vl=en">Mark Rober&rsquo;s videos</a> perfectly capture this struggle.)</p>

<p>My idea is to strike a truce with the squirrels by building a vending machine that dispenses exactly one walnut when a lever is pulled. A timer will ensure the lever can&rsquo;t be pulled more than once every 10 minutes.</p>

<img src="Sep_9__Doc_2-removebg-preview.png" alt="IDEA 2: The Moisture-Sensitive Watering Can" class="center">

<h3 class="highlight">IDEA 2: The Moisture-Sensitive Watering Can</h3>

<p>This idea draws inspiration from two experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>My final project for Stanford's Design and Manufacturing class, where I designed a brass watering can with an undulating spout. I machined the parts but never got to brazing and finishing, as we were sent home early this quarter due to the pandemic :(</li>
<li>My garden this past summer, in which moisture-sensitive drip irrigation would have been extremely useful to keep my plants alive while I was away.</li>
</ul>

<p>The concept is to build a moisture-sensitive watering can for a single house plant. I would 3D print or CNC a design inspired by my original undulating spout and connect it to a soil moisture sensor. The can would tip and water the plant only when the soil is dry.</p>

<h3 class="highlight">IDEA 3: The Kinetic Mobile</h3>

<p>This project is inspired by the installation <em>As Long as the Sun Lasts</em> at one of my favorite museums, the Louisiana in Denmark. The piece would feature a graceful cascade of circles attached to a central stem, rotating at a consistent speed.</p>

<p>There's also potential to incorporate light (to create shifting colors) and sound, transforming it into a beautiful, immersive artistic experience. Unlike the other ideas, this one would be purely artistic rather than functional.</p>

<h1>Part II: Website Setup</h1>

<p class="p1">This week, I set up the &ldquo;bones&rdquo; of my PS70 website. I come from a visual design background, and while I&rsquo;ve always been interested in HTML/CSS, I never had the chance to learn it. I&rsquo;m excited to use this course as an opportunity to experiment.</p>

<p class="p1">I drew inspiration from both visual design and mechanical engineering portfolios. My goal is to create a site that feels clean and visually striking, while also incorporating whimsical touches (e.g., hand-drawn elements).</p>

  <div class="gif-grid">
    <img src="Sample 1 Gif 1.gif" alt="GIF 1">
    <img src="Sample 2 Gif 1.gif" alt="GIF 2">
    <img src="Sample 3 Gif 1.gif" alt="GIF 3">
  </div>

<br></br>

<p class="p1">Sample portfolios referenced above: <a href="https://www.jnatchen.com/">Jia Natalia Chen</a>, <a href="https://johnhong.xyz/">John Hong</a>, <a href="https://www.vkgreg.com/">Vanessa Gregorchik</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">To achieve this effect, I typeset everything in Courier New and plan to&nbsp;integrate visual artifacts of rapid prototyping&mdash;hand sketches, highlighting, masking tape, etc. For example, I sketched on post-it notes, scanned them, and turned them into transparent images for the site.</p>

<p class="p1">Ideas I&rsquo;d like to keep working on (long list!):</p>
<ul>
<p class="p1">Add links between pages so viewers can easily navigate week to week (inspired by <a href="https://alyssasuh.github.io/PS70/01_intro/index.html">Alyssa Suh&rsquo;s site</a> from last year)</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Create hand-written masking tape elements for headers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Experiment with annotations&mdash;for example, hovering over text to trigger in-line image pop-ups&nbsp;for each project I list in the &ldquo;About&rdquo; section</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Refine image layout for better flow and readability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Incorporate animations, potentially using hand-illustrated GIFs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Improve home page previews for each week&rsquo;s project (e.g., photo hover effects, similar to <a href="https://alyssasuh.github.io/PS70/index.html">Alyssa Suh&rsquo;s design</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>
