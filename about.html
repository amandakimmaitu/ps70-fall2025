<p class="p1">hi, I'm amanda! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p class="p1">the most honest, gratifying, and fun part of my life is making things! I&rsquo;m excited to grow my designer / crafter / maker toolkit in PS 70 and (hopefully) create some&nbsp;projects I&rsquo;m proud of :-)</p>

<p class="p1">some of my favorite things I&rsquo;ve made:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">functional ceramic dishware, hand-thrown on the wheel</li>
<li class="p1">a&nbsp;modular, lightweight&nbsp;recovery bed for&nbsp;south indian homecare settings</li>
<li class="p1">my beloved community garden plot at stanford, which I built (with lots of help!), tended to all summer, and currently and miss very&nbsp;much :')</li>
<li class="p1">ultra low-cost surgical safety solutions for scrub nurses in&nbsp;addis ababa, ethiopia</li>
<li class="p1">new digital government tools to promote employment outcomes, while working as a strategy consultant in&nbsp;saudi arabia</li>
<li class="p1">multi-course meals for dinner parties with friends</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">I&rsquo;m originally from louisville, kentucky; studied product design as an undergrad at stanford; and am currently pursuing a joint MPA/MBA at the harvard kennedy school and stanford graduate school of business. in my spare time, I love scuba diving, powerlifting, and seeking out warm patches of grass for naps.</p>

<p class="p1">a special shoutout to my sister allison (harvard '23), who urged me to take this course and inspires me to never let work get in the way of making cool stuff.</p>
